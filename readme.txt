# Instant Imager - Text to Image Generation Using Streamlit

**Project Name**: Instant Imager  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Streamlit, Hugging Face API, PIL, Requests

---

## Overview

**Instant Imager** is a Streamlit-based application that generates images from textual prompts using the Hugging Face API. It allows users to input a text description, and the app will generate and display an image based on that description. The project leverages a Hugging Face model to generate creative images, with a stylish and interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate images based on user input.
- **Stylish UI**: A sleek, modern interface with a unique color theme and animations.
- **Image Download**: Users can download generated images.
- **Prompt History**: The app remembers previous prompts and generated images for easy access.
- **Loading Animation**: Visual feedback while the image is being generated.
- **Custom Sidebar**: The sidebar includes branding and a space for previous prompts.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Requests
- PIL (Pillow)

To install the necessary Python packages, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests pillow
```

Additionally, you will need an API key for Hugging Face. Set up your Hugging Face API key by adding it to your environment variables:

```bash
export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

You can get your Hugging Face API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
